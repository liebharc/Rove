A rather specific tool which pretends to a window manager for Tomcat console windows. The use case is that in our development environment we typically have a lot of Tomcats running. Every one of them opens its console window which quickly becomes overwhelming. With this tool all the Tomcat windows will appears inside of one application.

It works by hiding the Tomcat windows and showing a log file instead (e.g. catalina.out). Intended target platform is Windows. Configuration is XML and script based.
